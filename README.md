# Task-02: Customer Segmentation with K-means Clustering


# Project Overview
This project implements a K-means clustering algorithm to group retail store customers based on their purchase history. The objective is to identify distinct customer segments, enabling businesses to better understand customer behavior, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance decision-making processes.

# Key Highlights
Dataset: The project uses the Customer Segmentation Dataset from Kaggle.
Approach:
Preprocessed the data by handling missing values, scaling features, and ensuring data quality.
Applied the K-means clustering algorithm to categorize customers based on features like spending patterns and purchase frequency.
Used the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Visualized the results to provide insights into different customer groups.
Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
# Results
The project successfully segments customers into meaningful clusters, offering actionable insights that can be used to personalize customer experiences and improve business strategies.

This project highlights the power of unsupervised learning techniques in extracting valuable patterns from raw data.
